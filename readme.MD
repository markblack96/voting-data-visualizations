Data visualization tools for the Voteview dataset using python and d3.js

Current todos:
- Potentially separate some data from CongresspersonParty
- API endpoints for other questions (congresspersons that represented what state, what district?)
- individual voting histories for selected congresspersons
- set SVG sizes dynamcially
- remove data/ (limit exceeded on storage)
- clickthrough bill viewer with yea/nay breakdown
- individual bill search
- better layout
- component-ize visualizations and tools
- pages for congresses (with ability to explore individual congressperson's voting histories per congress), individual bills, individual congresspersons (searchable by district? party? etc.)
- if returning empty datasets, send message informing as such
- use state object
