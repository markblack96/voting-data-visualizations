Data visualization tools for the Voteview dataset using python and d3.js

Current todos:
- Attach congressional district data to CongresspersonParty or congressperson_state
- Potentially separate some data from CongresspersonParty
- API endpoints for other questions (congresspersons that represented what state, what district?)
- First visualizations
